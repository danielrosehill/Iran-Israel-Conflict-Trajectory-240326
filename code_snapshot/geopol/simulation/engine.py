"""Stage A — actor simulation.

Wraps a lightweight loop over OpenRouter modelled on snowglobe's
`Control` / `Player` pattern (`examples/ac_sim.py`). We keep the sim
self-contained here rather than depending on llm-snowglobe's heavier
optional stack (torch, transformers, llama-cpp) — the dep is still listed
in `pyproject.toml` so a `snowglobe`-backed engine can be swapped in later
without touching the pipeline boundary.

Referee rules (§"What world state means"):
- Actors see ONLY the referee-authored world state. No raw news, no Tavily,
  no other actors' private reasoning.
- Turn 0 world state = base_context + forecast question + terse RSS/ISW seed.
- Turn 1..N world state = referee narration of previous-turn actions.
