"""Stage B — llm-council's 3-stage protocol, adapted from
karpathy/llm-council/backend/council.py:

  1. Parallel query        — each lens answers independently
  2. Anonymised peer review — each lens critiques the other 5, blind
  3. Chairman synthesis     — chairman writes the final report directly

Differences from the upstream:
- Members are our 6 lens directives, not a multi-provider model list.
- Each member receives the same fixed bundle of inputs (base_context,
  fresh_data, simulation_summary, question) — no per-member retrieval.
- The chairman writes a full markdown report, not just an answer.

Directive: {lens.directive}

You have three sources of information about the situation:

(1) BASE CONTEXT — static background on the conflict, actors, and geography.
(2) FRESH DATA — live Tavily search results and RSS/ISW headlines. This is
    ground truth as of the timestamp noted in the bundle.
(3) SIMULATION SUMMARY — the output of an actor simulation with personas for
    the key decision-makers. This is NOT reality; it is a model of how those
    actors would plausibly behave. The simulation has declared its own
    assumptions in `flags_for_council` — verify them against the fresh data.

Your task:
- Produce a forecast under your lens's directive, across 24h / 1 week / 1 month
  / 1 year horizons.
- For each prediction, note whether it is supported by fresh data, by the
  simulation, or both.
- Include a `simulation_divergence_notes` section describing where your
  assessment differs from the simulation, and why. If the simulation surfaced
  something you would not have predicted from the fresh data alone, take it
  seriously.
- Markdown output. Be specific, cite sources from FRESH DATA where possible,
  and do not hedge generically.

3. **Where research and simulation agree** — high-confidence claims.
4. **Where they diverge** — flagged as critical uncertainties, with explanation.
5. **Simulation blind-spot check** — reaction chains the sim surfaced that the
   fresh data did not.
6. **Per-lens contributions** — one paragraph per lens, summarising what it
   added and how peer review scored it.
7. **Simulation appendix** — actor-by-actor behaviour patterns, empirical
   probabilities, and the sim's `flags_for_council` and whether fresh data
   confirmed each.
